# Data integration using Azure Data Factory and Azure Data Share

As customers embark on their modern data warehouse and analytics projects, they require not only more data but also more visibility into their data across their data estate. This workshop dives into how improvements to Azure Data Factory and Azure Data Share simplify data integration and management in Azure. From enabling code-free ETL/ELT to creating a comprehensive view over your data, improvements in Azure Data Factory will empower your data engineers to confidently bring in more data, and thus more value, to your enterprise. Also, learn about Azure Data Share and how you can do B2B sharing in a governed manner.

In this workshop, you will ingest data from an Azure SQL database into Azure Data Lake Storage gen2. Once you land the data in the lake, you will transform it via mapping data flows, ADF's native transformation service, and sink it into Azure SQL data warehouse.
